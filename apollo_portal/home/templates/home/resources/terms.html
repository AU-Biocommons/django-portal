    for visualising and sharing genome assemblies and annotations, and curating
    (i.e. manually improving) genome annotations.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <h3>Apollo Portal</h3>
  <p>
    The Apollo Portal is the website
    <a class="myclass" href="https://apollo-portal.genome.edu.au/">
      apollo-portal.genome.edu.au
    </a>
    where researchers can access information about the Apollo Service, access
    public genome tracks, and apply for the creation of an Apollo Instance.
    Users can also find relevant documentation and guidelines regarding service
    support, funding, acknowledgement, tutorials, and frequently asked
    questions.
  </p>
  <h3>Apollo Service</h3>
  <p>
    The “Apollo Service” (the Service) is offered by the
    <a class="myclass" href="https://www.biocommons.org.au/">
      Australian BioCommons
    </a>
    <sup>
      <a href="#ref_2"> [2] </a>
    </sup>
    and a number of its Operational Partners as part of their collective mission
    to provide access to the digital techniques, data and tools, used by
    environmental, agricultural and biomedical researchers.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    The Service includes hosted Apollo Instances where the majority of the
    systems administration tasks are taken care of by the Operators of the
    Service, allowing&nbsp;Australian-based research groups to upload genome
    assembly, genome annotation and supporting evidence files, and focus on the
    annotation curation itself. Apollo Service is the complete Service that is
    provided to its users which includes the creation of an Apollo Instance,
    ongoing user support, maintenance of the instance, communications about the
    Service, the creation and improvement of tutorials and documentation, and
    the development and delivery of training materials and workshops.
  </p>
  <h3>Apollo Instance</h3>
  <p>
    An Apollo Instance is a virtual machine running the Apollo software that is
    used to host data owned by your research group or consortium created with
    the software package, Apollo
    <sup>
      <a href="#ref_1"> [1] </a>
    </sup>
    . The Apollo Instance, if granted, will be hosted on resources provided by
    the Apollo Service.
  </p>
  <h3 id="UserType">User Types</h3>
  <p>
    Due to the nature of how a hosted Apollo Instance can be created and managed
    through the Service, this document discerns between the following distinct
    user types and roles. Note that one individual may perform more than one of
    these roles.

    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong> 2. Data hosting and analysis </strong>
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>
      The Apollo Service is designed to support visualising, curating,
      annotating and sharing genome assemblies and annotations. If you choose to
      upload and host data in the Service you shall ensure that you comply with
      applicable laws, including, but not limited to, privacy, data protection
      and intellectual property rights. It is the responsibility of the
      Principal Investigator and Project Administrator of an Apollo Instance to
      notify End Users of their responsibility to comply with these laws.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      The Apollo Service is not designed to handle sensitive data, including
      potentially re-identifiable data. You are prohibited from using the
      Service to store or process sensitive data, including but not limited to
      personally identifying genetic, genomic or medical data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Due to the incremental and long-term nature of manual genome annotation
      curation, the Apollo Service is designed for long term storage of genome
      assembly and annotation data. However, the overall Service is subject to
      storage quota limits, and it is necessary for Project and Organism
      Administrators, to routinely monitor the volume of large supporting data
      files (e.g. BAM) associated with each organism. Please only host large
      supporting data files for the period required for analysis/curation and
      then export/download supporting data files.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      If an Instance is underutilised, the Apollo Service Operational Partners
      reserve the right to reallocate the resources to other users. &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator and Project
      Administrator to ensure all other Administrators, Curators and End Users
      have read, acknowledged and adhered to these Terms of Use.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong> 3. Sharing content </strong>
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>
      The Apollo Service is designed to support open science. Project and
      Organism Administrators may choose to share “content” (such as
      annotations). &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Principal Investigators, Project and Organism Administrators and any End
      Users (Curators) associated with each organism are the collective owners
      of this content.
    </li>
    <li>
      Principal Investigators, Project and Organism Administrators can choose to
      delete their content at any time.

  <p>
    <strong> 4. Termination </strong>
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>
      The Apollo Service Operational Partners reserve the right, without notice,
      at its sole discretion and without liability:&nbsp;
      <ol start="1">
        <li>
          to alter, delete or block access to content that it deems to be
          inappropriate, and&nbsp;

  <p>
    <strong> &nbsp; 6. Service maintenance and downtime </strong>
  </p>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>
      The Apollo Service will have scheduled recurring and occasional
      maintenance downtime for updates and security patching of the Service.
      Recurring scheduled maintenance downtime will occur each Monday morning
      between 8:00 am and 9:00 am AEST. During these periods, the Service may
      become momentarily unavailable due to necessary and unavoidable
      maintenance and/or testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Occasional scheduled maintenance downtimes will be reserved for larger
      upgrades, updates or testing, and will occur irregularly outside of the
      normal scheduled recurring maintenance timeframes. Users will be notified
      two weeks prior to an occasional scheduled maintenance downtime via email
      communication at the address provided by the user when joining the Apollo
      Service.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      In the event of a security breach, Apollo Portal and Apollo Service may
      need to perform urgent maintenance resulting in Service downtime at a time
      other than the scheduled maintenance windows. In this case, Apollo Portal
      and Apollo Service will make every effort to give the user/s as much
      advance notice as is possible to limit disruption.&nbsp;

  <h3>
    Best effort operations
    <br />
    &nbsp;
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Apollo Service Operational Partners realise that the data and
    annotations you host with Apollo Service are important to you. &nbsp;For
    that reason, the Apollo Service Operational Partners commit to making the
    best efforts to keep the Service as reliable and responsive as possible and
    to keep your data intact.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    Our operational staff work normal Australian East Coast office hours. During
    those hours the Apollo Service Operational Partners aim to triage tickets,
    tool requests and reference data requests within one business day.
    Resolution of tickets, requests, outages and issues will take longer outside
    normal office hours, on weekends, and on public holidays.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Apollo Service runs research-grade infrastructure contributed by the
    Apollo Service Operational Partners. Apollo Portal and Apollo Service’s
    reliability and capacity may be impacted if partner infrastructure
    unexpectedly becomes unavailable.
    <br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <h3>
    Service capacity
    <br />
    &nbsp;
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Apollo Service is underpinned by significant compute and storage
    capabilities, allowing you to scale analysis beyond your desktop computer.
    The Apollo Service Operational Partners periodically project capacity
    requirements, taking into account growth in users, jobs and community
    requests for new types of analysis that might need specialised hardware.
    <br />
    From time to time the Apollo Service may reach capacity, resulting in delays
    in provisioning new Apollo Instances.
    <br />
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <h3>
    Service lifetime
    <br />
    &nbsp;
  </h3>
  <p>
    The service will continue for the lifetime of the Australian BioCommons,
    which is currently funded until June 2023.
    <br />
    In case of closure of the Service, registered account holders can download
    their hosted data and content via Apollo’s existing
