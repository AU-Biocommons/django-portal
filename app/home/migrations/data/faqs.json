    "question": "What is the Apollo Service?\n",
    "answer": "The Apollo software package is a web-based tool for visualising           genomic contents and manually improving gene predictions. It allows           researchers to work on a reference genome collaboratively. The Apollo           Service provides Australian-based researchers with customised, local           instances of the Apollo software for their genome projects.\n"

    "answer": "The service is funded to support\n<a href=\"/resources/terms#AusUni\">\n Australian-based research groups and consortia\n</a>\n, and only Principal Investigators with an institutional email           address from an\n<a href=\"/resources/terms#AusUni\">\n Australian research institution\n</a>\nmay apply for a hosted Apollo Instance. International collaborators           are however very welcome to be invited to collaborate within an           established Instance or view data. This is at the discretion of the           Instance managers, i.e. the Instance Project Administrator and/or           Principal Investigator.\n"

  {
    "question": "Can Apollo automatically annotate my genome?\n",
    "answer": "No. Apollo is a tool to manually correct genome annotations that have           already been produced from automated tools or pipelines.
